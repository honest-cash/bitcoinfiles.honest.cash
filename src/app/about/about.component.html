    The Bitcoin Cash blockchain is an immutable, globally distributed, pseudo-anonymous data storage device. BitcoinFiles.com was developed due to a lack of reliable and anonymous file upload and file sharing web services. BitcoinFiles.com allows anyone or any system to upload files to IPFS and the Bitcoin Cash blockchain without requiring login credentials. Files uploaded to IPFS and the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain can be shared with anyone in the world using a simple URL (e.g., https://bitcoinfiles.com/791cdde4c6f8ac244a57be5a0eb003f26618a680ff1ffccf9843386b5a4f1410).
